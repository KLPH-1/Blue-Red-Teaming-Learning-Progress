Firstly you must have installed Wazuh and link the agent to the device that you wish to defend. I encourage you to try it yourself if you haven't done those yet. Youtube,AI anything as long as you are learning new things.

Let's move on to the point since you have installed wazuh it'll be the first thing you'll see when you log into wazuh. -wazuh.png

go and check the active devices. -wazuh(win).png

click the device and you'll see beautifully presented dashboard. -wazuh(dash).png

This part will be the part after the red team side has done the attack,open up the SCA. -SCA(waz).png

you'll see some failed attempts in my case there was 350 of those. -fails(waz).png

this part is the part when we know we were brute forced via remote access. -brutelog.png

Now we must stop the attacked device and report back to senior for the follow up.
