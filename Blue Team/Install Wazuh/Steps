I am installing Wazuh on Ubuntu VM.

first in terminal log in as super user. -superuser.png

In browser go wo wazuh website and into the documentation. -wazuh site.png

There is installation guide provided in the documentation. -install guide.png

copy the cmd and paste it into your terminal and for the bash command instead of copying all use -a to install all the wazuh contents. -curlwazuh.png -bashinstall.png

You'll get your username and password along with the ip address to log into the wazuh.

type the ip address into the browser and use the provided username and password.

to monitor your targeted device first you must know the ip of the sever's device. -ipconfig.png

if the ip is wrong please check the VM's network system. use Bridge adpator as network system.

In the wazuh dashboard you'll see add agent and proceed to it.

choose your targeted device type . Window or Linux Debian based. -severaddress.png

Copy the link and paste it in your targeted device. -agentcopy.png

It'll automatically install the agent on your targeted device . Restart the device and Wazuh is ready to uses
