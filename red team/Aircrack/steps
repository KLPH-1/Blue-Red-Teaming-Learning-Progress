Today we shall crack wifi password

Check your wifi device. -iwconfig.png

Then stop all the services that is running on the wifi device. -airmonng.png

And then start your wifi device as a monitor mode which can sniff all the wifi on the vicinity. -armonstart.png

Let's start the sniffing process. -airodump.png

You'll see all the wifi that is on your vicinity. -bssidall.png

Focus on the target wifi. In my case it's my wifi named MCC. -targetwifi.png

Make the targeted wifi disconnect to its connected device by deauthing. -deaugh.png

Once the device try to logs in to the wifi you'll capture the handshake hash. -captures.png

To crack the password, you must first make your word lists.You may use any style to make a word list. I have shown some examples there by using crunch and seq. -lists(crunch).png  -phlist(seq).png

Start the cracking.  -cracking.png

since i already know my wifi password I created an easy list that will catch the password early and this is the result. -passwordcracked.png

it took about 11 mins to check 9 Millions of numbers on my device which is core i5 cpu.
To be able to use wifi back you have to stop the monitor mode  (sudo airmon-ng stop wlan0mon) and then (sudo systemctl start NetworkManager)
you may use hashcat which can utilize the power of GPU to fasten the process.

Pre install the nvidia driver and cuda toolkit as well as hashcat. (sudo apt install nvidia-driver) (sudo apt install nvidia-cuda-toolkit) (sudo apt install hashcat) restart if needed.

To use hashcat. We must change the capture.cap to hashcat's file format. -changefiletype.png

check your file. -checkhc.png

Use hashcat. -hashcat.png

Password cracked. -hashpasswordcracked.png

It took me 45 second to crack 9 Millions of numbers which is pretty fast compared to CPU that took 11 mins and my GPU is only RTX 3060. It'd be a lot faster if I got a better GPU. 
That's all for now . Enjoy the Progress.
