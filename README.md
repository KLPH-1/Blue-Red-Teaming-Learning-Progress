For Educational Purpose and Showcase of my skills for those who concrens

My name is Kaung La Pyae Hein managing at MCC Hpa-an as a computer trainer. I've traded my time of attending Uni with learning new things as a way to satiate my curiousitiy in subjects such as accounting/music/maths and especially IT. This repo is a way to learn for some and acting as a resume for me. You may email me at klph1klph@gmail.com and critic regarding the commits on this repo. Enjoy the progress.
