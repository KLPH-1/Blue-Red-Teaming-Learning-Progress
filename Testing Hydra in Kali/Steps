first install a VM on your device. as for me it's window 11. -window11(VM).png

check your window version. -Dxdiag(W11).png

if your window version is home version you won't be able to do remote assess control. -win(ver).png

if your window is in home edition , don't worry we can fix it. open up the powershell as admin. -powershell.png

and type as in the picture -winacti.png

in there you can activate your window and change your window edition as well as activate the MS.office -changeWinEdi.png

once you have changed the window edition open up remote desktop in the setting. -remote.png -remote(on).png

check your VM's IP. you must use bridge adapator network in VM's setting. Once donw type ipconfig in your VM(window11). -win(ping).png

It's now ready to attack. In your Kali device prepare some username and password files. I have some example in the picture. -us&pass.png

now run the hydra script. -hydra.png

You'll be able to see the matching username and password if it's matches with your user name and password.In my case it was Testing(username) and 12345678(password)

Congrats now we know how to use hydra. For more information I advice you to check the documentation.
